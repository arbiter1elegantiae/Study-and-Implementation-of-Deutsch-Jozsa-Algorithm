Study-and-Implementation-of-Deutsch-Jozsa-Algorithm

The repo contains all the work related to my degree (undergraduate level) dissertation in computer science at the University of Bologna.

This thesis is about understanding the foundations of quantum computing and its potential by analyzing computational speed up of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. It is also about how to build quantum circuits  
to compute specific functions and to implement those circuits in real quantum scripts using a domain specific language (QScript). Some results on linear balanced Boolean functions are also present. 

The thesis is structured as follows:

	Chapter 1: balaced Boolean functions are discussed, retrived some "special" istancies that will serve for the implementation of the Deutsch-Jozsa's algorithm.

	Chapter 2: introduction to the quantum computing model: qubit, superposition, dynamics, larger systems, entanglement, how to work with parallelism ecc..

	Chapter 3: formulation of the problem resolved by DJ, correctness, complexity advantages.

	Chapter 4: implementation of DJ on Quantum Playground on balanced B functions obtained in the first part, construction of the oracle, QScript code and results.

	Chapter 5: conclusion: potential and limits of the model, why quantum playground, whats next.   


Contents and slides are written in Italian. QScript scripts (.txt files) are explained in english.
